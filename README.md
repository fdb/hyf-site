# Hack Your Future site in React

Example site built in React, for [Hack Your Future Belgium React class](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/React).

This project contains two versions. You can pick which one you like in `index.js`.

* **Static version**: The different pages of the site are hard-coded in the `pages` directory. This works well if you have a limited number of pages.
* **Dynamic version**: The pages are stored in a "database" under `data/pages.js`. The `Page` component will extract title, body and blocks from the database and render a page on the fly. This is a good approach if you have many pages and want to add a CMS for your site.
